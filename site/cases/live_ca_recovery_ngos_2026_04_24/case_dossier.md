# Case Dossier: Live web case: large California recovery and treatment nonprofits

## 1. Supervisor Brief

Bottom line: CalDS flags Tarzana Treatment Centers Inc, HealthRIGHT 360, WestCare California Inc, Behavioral Health Services Inc, CRI-Help Inc, Social Model Recovery Systems Inc, Phoenix Houses Of California Inc for possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review because Phoenix Houses Of California Inc has California Department of Health Care Services facility footprint in Los Angeles; official county or Continuum of Care context flags drug overdose death rate up 69.6%. Parsed entity growth context: spending=+53.4%, revenue=+7.4%, government grants=not parsed. Evidence: `E19`, `E20`, `source_table_official_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`. The lead score is 63.91 / 100 and the sentinel posture is `DOWNGRADE_FOR_REVIEW`; this is a review priority, not a formal conclusion.

### What CalDS Found First

- `E19` Official outcome-source manifest for spend-versus-results review (Parsed official outcome source table, 2026-04-24): Official outcome source acquisition manifest. Sources are deterministic inputs for spend-versus-results screening; they do not attribute county outcomes to any provider. | source | title | fetched | row_count | join_grain | source_url | error | | --- | --- |... Source: [internal local artifact]
- `E20` Deterministic spend-versus-results join for target entities and counties (Parsed spend-versus-results join, 2026-04-24): Deterministic join from parsed Internal Revenue Service spending/grant growth, California Department of Health Care Services facility counties/capacity, and official county or Continuum of Care outcome series. County outcomes are context, not provider-attributable results. | entity | county | risk_level | outcome_flags |... Source: [internal local artifact]
- `E22` Public statement page harvest: WestCare California Inc (Public statement source, 2026-04-24): on addressing social influencers of health and implement homelessness: es building the resiliency of individuals who face barriers including trauma, abuse, chemical dependency, severe behavioral health disorders, developmental disabilities, homelessness, and...

### Why This Is On A Reviewer's Desk

- CalDS flags Phoenix Houses Of California Inc / Spend-versus-results: Phoenix Houses Of California Inc has California Department of Health Care Services facility footprint in Los Angeles; official county or Continuum of Care context flags drug overdose death rate up 69.6%. Parsed entity growth context: spending=+53.4%, revenue=+7.4%, government grants=not parsed. Evidence: `E19`, `E20`, `source_table_official_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`. Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.
- CalDS flags Phoenix Houses Of California Inc / Spend-versus-results: Phoenix Houses Of California Inc has California Department of Health Care Services facility footprint in Stanislaus; official county or Continuum of Care context flags drug overdose death rate up 78.7%. Parsed entity growth context: spending=+53.4%, revenue=+7.4%, government grants=not parsed. Evidence: `E19`, `E20`, `source_table_official_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`. Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.
- CalDS flags HealthRIGHT 360 / Public statements: Configured public statement pages were harvested. Matched review terms: advocacy, public affairs, criminal justice, equity. Evidence: `public_statements_healthright`. Public claims and program language matter when they point to activities that may need contract-scope, grant-scope, or lobbying-disclosure review.
- CalDS flags Tarzana Treatment Centers Inc / Public statements: Configured public statement pages were harvested. Matched review terms: advocacy. Evidence: `public_statements_tarzana`. Public claims and program language matter when they point to activities that may need contract-scope, grant-scope, or lobbying-disclosure review.
- Source blockers to resolve before stronger ranking: Audit controls, Executive compensation, Facility status, Financial growth; plus 5 other source area(s). These are collection blockers, not adverse findings.

### Decision Needed

- Human-review state: `PENDING`. The workflow is paused until a reviewer approves, downgrades, repairs, or rejects the case.
- Score: 63.91 / 100. Reviewable triage priority with caveats or missing data.
- Sentinel: `DOWNGRADE_FOR_REVIEW`. Lead can proceed only as an internal reviewer-safe candidate with caveats.
- Immediate reviewer action: Request provider-attributable utilization, completion, discharge, cost-per-service, and outcome records for the same county and year window.

### What This Does Not Prove

- This dossier does not make a formal finding of waste, fraud, or abuse. It identifies possible screening questions and source blockers for human review.
- County or Continuum of Care outcomes are contextual unless provider-attributable outcome records are recovered and linked.
- Sentinel restrictions remain active: audit_review_signal, facility_status_context_required, county_source_context_required, docket_context_required, missing_data.

### Plain-Language Source Glossary

- Federal Audit Clearinghouse: federal audit report, findings, and award data used for audit-control review.
- California Department of Health Care Services: California licensing, facility-status, and adverse-action source context.
- Internal Revenue Service: federal tax-return source for Form 990 revenue, expense, grant, and compensation fields.
- Continuum of Care: regional homelessness-services geography used in official outcome datasets.
- Employer Identification Number: federal tax identifier used to match nonprofit records.
- Machine-readable filing data: structured source files used for source-system returns and extracts.
- Source document: original audit, tax-return, or records file used as the controlling record.

## 2. Entity Briefs

These briefs assume the reader has not seen the agent work. They summarize specific cited records first, then explain why the system held or flagged each nonprofit organization.

### Phoenix Houses Of California Inc

Briefing judgment: CalDS flags Phoenix Houses Of California Inc as a high-priority possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review subject.

What the organization says or is described as doing: retrieved source `Official service/program page harvest: Phoenix Houses Of California Inc` says or summarizes: - At Phoenix House California, we take a holistic approach to drug addiction and mental health disorders that focuses on the power of being both proactive and reactive: prevention, early intervention, and recovery services.

Implemented screen results:

- No implemented high or medium possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement screen fired for this entity from the current matrix.
- Spend-versus-results: official county or Continuum of Care outcome context worsened in the entity's matched California Department of Health Care Services footprint: Los Angeles: drug overdose death rate up 69.6%; Stanislaus: drug overdose death rate up 78.7%. Parsed entity growth context: spending=+53.4%, revenue=+7.4%, government grants=not parsed. This is a review signal, not provider attribution. Evidence `E19`, `E20`, `source_table_official_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`.
- Source gaps that limit judgment: Audit controls, Executive compensation, Facility status, Financial growth; plus 4 other source area(s). These gaps explain what CalDS still cannot test; they are not adverse findings by themselves.

### Case-wide Source Gaps

These are not nonprofit organization-specific findings. They are run-level blockers that limit how strongly CalDS can rank or clear the case.

- Public attention and traffic: No social media account metrics, website analytics, ad-library records, or third-party traffic estimates are ingested in this run.
  Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row. Human action: Collect the missing source named in the row and rerun the matrix before upgrading the signal.


## 3. Score, Sentinel, and Case Context

Lead statement: Retrieved records show a reviewable oversight signal for Tarzana Treatment Centers Inc, HealthRIGHT 360 focused on recovery, services, treatment.

Score: 63.91 / 100

Interpretation: reviewable triage lead with meaningful source coverage, but caveats or missing data prevent upgrade without human verification.

The score is deterministic triage priority, not a probability, not a dollar loss estimate, and not a conclusion. Higher scores mean stronger retrieved-source coverage and entity linkage after missing-data and contradiction penalties.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Support count | 69 |
| Average relevance | 0.683 |
| Source diversity | 22 |
| Hard entity links | 21 |
| Missing-data count | 7 |
| Contradiction count | 0 |

### Sentinel Gate

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Decision | DOWNGRADE_FOR_REVIEW |
| Rationale | Lead can proceed only as an internal reviewer-safe candidate with caveats. |
| Flags | audit_review_signal, facility_status_context_required, county_source_context_required, docket_context_required, missing_data |

Sentinel repair or caution items:

- Keep audit and Schedule L references as review questions until source documents are checked.
- Keep California Department of Health Care Services status records at facility-level context unless a reviewer confirms entity-level meaning.
- Require reviewer confirmation of current county contract or monitoring status.
- Treat docket pointers as follow-up tasks until the docket is directly verified.
- Preserve missing-data caveats in the review packet.

### Case Summary

- Case ID: `live_ca_recovery_ngos_2026_04_24`
- Jurisdiction: California
- Objective: Using public Form 990 XML for the 2023-2025 tax-period window where available, Federal Audit Clearinghouse audit source documents and award ledgers, California Department of Health Care Services facility-status records, county contract or monitoring records, litigation docket manifests, and organization service-page records, identify reviewer-safe oversight triage signals among large California drug recovery and substance use treatment nonprofits.

## 4. Case Dossier Orientation

Status: `PENDING` human review required

This dossier compiles existing CalDS workflow artifacts into a human-readable case file. It is an internal possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement screening aid, not a formal finding or outside-facing conclusion.

Every substantive row below is tied to a risk indicator, evidence item, source URI, checksum, or durable artifact path. Raw source documents and canonical records remain controlling.

Dossier mode: downgraded internal review dossier with caveats preserved

## 5. Evidence Detail By Entity

This section preserves the system opinion and source-fact detail behind the briefing memo. It remains an internal possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement screening opinion, not a formal allegation or outside-facing conclusion.

### CRI-Help Inc

CalDS flags CRI-Help Inc as a moderate-priority possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review subject. The entity is in this dossier because the current source bundle contains the specific source facts below.

Specific findings that drove the flag:

1. Medium - Spend-versus-results: CRI-Help Inc has California Department of Health Care Services facility footprint in Los Angeles; official county or Continuum of Care context flags drug overdose death rate up 69.6%. Parsed entity growth context: spending=+15.9%, revenue=+123.3%, government grants=not parsed.

   - Why it matters: Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.

2. Data gap - Audit controls: No Federal Audit Clearinghouse audit-control summary row is present for this entity in the current corpus.
   - When/where: subject: CRI-Help Inc
   - How it triggered: Data gap Audit controls screen via test 'Federal Audit Clearinghouse control flags and findings'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: `E14`, `E15`, `source_table_fac_audit_controls`, `source_table_fac_award_programs`; source: [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Audit-control flags are direct oversight signals; repeated or unresolved findings can indicate weak controls over public funds.

3. Data gap - Executive compensation: No parsed Part VII compensation total is available in the current Internal Revenue Service table for this entity.
   - When/where: subject: CRI-Help Inc
   - How it triggered: Data gap Executive compensation screen via test 'Highest officer/key employee compensation from Form 990 Part VII'. Data status: missing_parser_or_source_field.
   - Evidence: `E13`, `source_table_irs_990_financials`; source: [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: High executive pay at a publicly funded service nonprofit is a materiality and governance question; the reviewer needs to know whether pay, approval, and outcomes line up.

4. Data gap - Facility status: No parsed California Department of Health Care Services facility-status summary row is present for this entity.
   - When/where: place: California Department of Health Care Services facility set matched to the entity; subject: CRI-Help Inc

   - Why it matters: Rapid revenue or expense growth becomes a possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review concern when it outpaces visible service capacity, documented outcomes, or clear grant-scope explanations.

6. Data gap - Off-scope activity: No parsed PoliticalCampaignActyInd or LobbyingActivitiesInd field is available in the current Internal Revenue Service table for this entity.
   - When/where: subject: CRI-Help Inc
   - How it triggered: Data gap Off-scope activity screen via test 'Form 990 political campaign and lobbying indicators'. Data status: missing_source_or_field.

   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

2. Low - Spend-versus-results: Official outcome series are ingested and joined into 35 entity/county context rows. These rows remain contextual and are not provider-attributable results.
   - When/where: subject: Case-wide
   - How it triggered: Low Spend-versus-results screen via test 'Outcome-denominator coverage for homelessness, drug use, crime, and treatment results'. Data status: observed.

   - When/where: subject: Tarzana Treatment Centers Inc
   - How it triggered: Data gap Audit controls screen via test 'Federal Audit Clearinghouse control flags and findings'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: `E14`, `E15`, `source_table_fac_audit_controls`, `source_table_fac_award_programs`; source: [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Audit-control flags are direct oversight signals; repeated or unresolved findings can indicate weak controls over public funds.

4. Data gap - Executive compensation: No parsed Part VII compensation total is available in the current Internal Revenue Service table for this entity.
   - When/where: subject: Tarzana Treatment Centers Inc
   - How it triggered: Data gap Executive compensation screen via test 'Highest officer/key employee compensation from Form 990 Part VII'. Data status: missing_parser_or_source_field.
   - Evidence: `E13`, `source_table_irs_990_financials`; source: [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: High executive pay at a publicly funded service nonprofit is a materiality and governance question; the reviewer needs to know whether pay, approval, and outcomes line up.

5. Data gap - Facility status: No parsed California Department of Health Care Services facility-status summary row is present for this entity.
   - When/where: place: California Department of Health Care Services facility set matched to the entity; subject: Tarzana Treatment Centers Inc
   - How it triggered: Data gap Facility status screen via test 'California Department of Health Care Services active/closed facility-status ratio'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: `E16`, `source_table_dhcs_facility_status`; source: [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Facility closures or status changes can affect capacity, access, and contract performance; the system treats a high closed-facility ratio as a service-delivery red flag.

6. Data gap - Financial growth: No two downloaded Internal Revenue Service returns with numeric revenue are available for this entity. Available parsed years: none.
   - When/where: subject: Tarzana Treatment Centers Inc
   - How it triggered: Data gap Financial growth screen via test 'Year-over-year total revenue growth'. Data status: missing_source_or_field.
   - Evidence: `E13`, `source_table_irs_990_financials`; source: [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Rapid revenue or expense growth becomes a possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review concern when it outpaces visible service capacity, documented outcomes, or clear grant-scope explanations.

- The full matrix contains additional lower-priority source-backed review items for this entity.

Review stance: The system would not close this item from summary records alone; spending and footprint need provider-attributable outcome records.

## 6. Flagged Review Matrix

Methodology: Waste, fraud, and abuse risk-screening matrix generated from parsed Internal Revenue Service Form 990, Federal Audit Clearinghouse, California Department of Health Care Services facility-status, county/document index, and retrieved service-page records. The matrix tests observable risk proxies: year-over-year financial growth, spending growth, public-funds concentration, executive compensation, payroll scale, political/lobbying indicators, audit-control flags, award concentration, facility closure patterns, off-scope web-language checks, official county or Continuum of Care outcome context, and remaining provider-attributable outcome gaps.

Risk scale: Indicator levels: High=immediate reviewer follow-up, Medium=review queue, Low=context only, Data gap=required source missing or not parsed. Levels are screening priorities, not findings or allegations.

| Risk level | Count |
| --- | --- |
| High | 2 |
| Medium | 36 |
| Data gap | 57 |
| Low | 12 |

High and medium rows are review priorities. Data-gap rows are source-collection blockers. Low rows are not expanded here unless they are needed for context.

- What this does not prove: It does not prove the entity caused county or Continuum of Care outcome movement; it flags a spend/outcome question for review.
- Human next step: Request provider-attributable utilization, completion, discharge, cost-per-service, and outcome records for the same county and year window.
- Caveat: Outcome rows are county or Continuum of Care-level context; they are not provider-attributable results.
- Caveat: Homelessness SPM rows are Continuum of Care-grain and matched by county-name text where possible.
- Caveat: Drug overdose rows use county-level public health indicators, not provider client outcomes.

- What this does not prove: It does not prove misuse; growth can have ordinary program, accounting, merger, or grant-timing explanations.
- Human next step: Compare raw Internal Revenue Service machine-readable filing data/source document returns year over year, then separate program growth, grants, mergers, one-time receipts, and expense categories.
- Caveat: A missing year is not an adverse signal by itself, but it prevents the growth test.

- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a data blocker because No downloaded Internal Revenue Service row in the current corpus contains both government grants and total revenue for this entity. Without the missing source, the system cannot responsibly downgrade or clear the issue.
- Why this matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.
- What this flags: Recover the full return or schedule detail before ranking public-funds concentration.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove poor performance or misuse; it marks funding exposure that needs source and outcome review.
- Human next step: Trace award programs to contracts, grant terms, deliverables, and provider-attributable outcome reports.
- Caveat: Blank government-grant fields may reflect parser coverage or return presentation; verify against raw machine-readable filing data/source document.

#### Data gap-51: Behavioral Health Services Inc - Spending growth

- Test: Year-over-year total expense growth
- What CalDS found: No two downloaded Internal Revenue Service returns with numeric expenses are available for this entity. Available parsed years: none.
- When/where: subject: Behavioral Health Services Inc
- How this triggered review: Data gap Spending growth screen via test 'Year-over-year total expense growth'. Data status: missing_source_or_field.
- Evidence refs: `E13`, `source_table_irs_990_financials`
- Source URI(s): [internal local artifact]
- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a data blocker because No two downloaded Internal Revenue Service returns with numeric expenses are available for this entity. Available parsed years: none. Without the missing source, the system cannot responsibly downgrade or clear the issue.
- Why this matters: Rapid revenue or expense growth becomes a possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review concern when it outpaces visible service capacity, documented outcomes, or clear grant-scope explanations.
- What this flags: Check whether expense growth maps to funded scope, staffing, facilities, and documented service results.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove misuse; growth can have ordinary program, accounting, merger, or grant-timing explanations.
- Human next step: Compare raw Internal Revenue Service machine-readable filing data/source document returns year over year, then separate program growth, grants, mergers, one-time receipts, and expense categories.
- Caveat: A missing year is not an adverse signal by itself, but it prevents the growth test.

## 8. Human-Only Next Steps

These actions are outside the current CalDS runtime. They require a human reviewer or authorized records process before any escalation beyond internal review.

1. Open the review packet and verify each priority row against the cited evidence ledger before changing case status.
2. Resolve sentinel caution: Keep audit and Schedule L references as review questions until source documents are checked.
3. Resolve sentinel caution: Keep California Department of Health Care Services status records at facility-level context unless a reviewer confirms entity-level meaning.
4. Resolve sentinel caution: Require reviewer confirmation of current county contract or monitoring status.
5. Resolve sentinel caution: Treat docket pointers as follow-up tasks until the docket is directly verified.
6. Resolve sentinel caution: Preserve missing-data caveats in the review packet.
7. Verify raw Internal Revenue Service machine-readable filing data or official return images for revenue, expenses, grants, officer compensation, and year-over-year movement.
8. Open Federal Audit Clearinghouse audit source documents and findings tables to confirm audit year, finding status, federal agency, questioned-cost fields, and management response.
9. Pull California Department of Health Care Services facility license/status history and adverse-status records directly before using facility rows beyond context.
10. Request county contract files, monitoring letters, corrective-action status, deliverables, and provider-level outcome records for the same year window.
11. Benchmark officer and key employee compensation against comparable organizations and verify documented approval procedures.
12. Compare harvested public statements and web pages to grant scopes, contract restrictions, and accounting records; treat statements as context only.
13. Verify court or docket pointers directly in the relevant docket system before treating them as meaningful context.

## 10. Human Review Required

The workflow remains paused. A reviewer must explicitly approve, downgrade, repair, or reject this case before any outside-facing use.
