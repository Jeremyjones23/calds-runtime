# Case Dossier: Live web case: top California homelessness nonprofits by state Homekey award exposure

## 1. Supervisor Brief

Bottom line: CalDS keeps Weingart Center Association at the top of this 15-entity case for possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review because the top source-backed trigger is: An official federal press release dated October 16, 2025 says Steven Taylor was charged with seven counts of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, and one count of money laundering, and describes a Cheviot Hills property originally acquired for $11.2 million and contracted to sell to a homeless housing developer using City of Los Angeles and State of California public funds for $27.3 million in a double-escrow transaction hidden from the lender. Los Angeles City Clerk records identify the Cheviot Hills/Shelby Homekey 3 project as Weingart-related and later describe The Weingart Shelby at 3340 Shelby Drive. Evidence: `E08`, `E07`, `enforcement_docket_weingart_center_association_1`, `source_table_enforcement_docket`. The lead score is 7.67 / 100 and the sentinel posture is `DOWNGRADE_FOR_REVIEW`; this is a review priority, not a formal conclusion.

### Triage Gate

- First-pass triage screened 15 named entities before deep investigation.
- Deep-dive selection: Hope the Mission, Weingart Center Association, DignityMoves, The People Concern, California Supportive Housing.
- Context handoff check: PASS. Missing fields: none.
- Hope the Mission: High triage priority, selected for deep forensic review. Why: At least one official or high-materiality source trigger fired. Trigger: Official California housing award rows attach $115,337,991 in project-award exposure to Hope the Mission.

### Why This Is On A Reviewer's Desk

- CalDS flags Weingart Center Association / Enforcement and docket history: An official federal press release dated October 16, 2025 says Steven Taylor was charged with seven counts of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, and one count of money laundering, and describes a Cheviot Hills property originally acquired for $11.2 million and contracted to sell to a homeless housing developer using City of Los Angeles and State of California public funds for $27.3 million in a double-escrow transaction hidden from the lender. Los Angeles City Clerk records identify the Cheviot Hills/Shelby Homekey 3 project as Weingart-related and later describe The Weingart Shelby at 3340 Shelby Drive. Evidence: `E08`, `E07`, `enforcement_docket_weingart_center_association_1`, `source_table_enforcement_docket`. The row matters because it is a measurable source-backed proxy for public-funds oversight risk.
- CalDS flags California Supportive Housing / Spend-versus-results: California Supportive Housing has state-award project geography in Alameda, Sacramento; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Alameda Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 13,827 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 15,967 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+15.5%), Sacramento Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 18,432 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 22,889 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+24.2%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$51,891,854. Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`. Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.
- CalDS flags DignityMoves / Spend-versus-results: DignityMoves has state-award project geography in Alameda, San Bernardino, Ventura; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Alameda Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 13,827 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 15,967 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+15.5%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$77,180,702. Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`. Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.
- CalDS flags Hope the Mission / Spend-versus-results: Hope the Mission has state-award project geography in Los Angeles; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Los Angeles Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 97,572 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 106,676 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+9.3%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$115,337,991. Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`. Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.
- Source blockers to resolve before stronger ranking: Audit controls, Direct funding verification, Enforcement and docket history, Executive compensation; plus 8 other source area(s). These are collection blockers, not adverse findings.

### Decision Needed

- Human-review state: `PENDING`. The workflow is paused until a reviewer approves, downgrades, repairs, or rejects the case.
- Score: 7.67 / 100. Low deterministic score because unresolved source gaps outweigh the retrieved source coverage under the current formula.
- Sentinel: `DOWNGRADE_FOR_REVIEW`. Lead can proceed only as an internal reviewer-safe candidate with caveats.
- Immediate reviewer action: Open the cited source records for Weingart Center Association and compare the raw source wording to this row.

### What This Does Not Prove

- This dossier does not make a formal finding of waste, fraud, or abuse. It identifies possible screening questions and source blockers for human review.
- County or Continuum of Care outcomes are contextual unless provider-attributable outcome records are recovered and linked.
- Sentinel restrictions remain active: legal_status_context_required, missing_data.

### Plain-Language Source Glossary

- Federal Audit Clearinghouse: federal audit report, findings, and award data used for audit-control review.
- California Department of Health Care Services: California licensing, facility-status, and adverse-action source context.
- California Department of Housing and Community Development: state housing and homelessness grant source, including Homekey award records.
- Internal Revenue Service: federal tax-return source for Form 990 revenue, expense, grant, and compensation fields.
- Continuum of Care: regional homelessness-services geography used in official outcome datasets.
- Homekey: California housing grant program used here as a source of project-award records.
- Homeless Data Integration System: California homelessness data warehouse used for official outcome context.
- Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General: federal inspector-general source used for enforcement or prosecution press releases.
- Employer Identification Number: federal tax identifier used to match nonprofit records.
- Machine-readable filing data: structured source files used for source-system returns and extracts.
- Source document: original audit, tax-return, or records file used as the controlling record.

- Spend-versus-results: official county or Continuum of Care outcome context worsened in the entity's matched project geography: Alameda, Sacramento: Alameda Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 13,827 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 15,967 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+15.5%), Sacramento Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 18,432 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 22,889 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+24.2%).

Evidence `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`.
- Source gaps that limit judgment: Audit controls, Direct funding verification, Enforcement and docket history, Executive compensation; plus 6 other source area(s). These gaps explain what CalDS still cannot test; they are not adverse findings by themselves.

Why this is on the review list: CalDS sees the combination reviewers care about: material public-money exposure or financial movement, plus outcome context that moved the wrong direction in matched service geographies. That does not prove provider responsibility, but it is exactly the mismatch that should be briefed up for document review.

What this does not prove: It does not prove the entity caused county or Continuum of Care outcome movement; it flags a spend/outcome question for review. It does not prove poor performance or misuse; it marks funding exposure that needs source and outcome review.

Boss-level next step: Request provider-attributable utilization, completion, discharge, cost-per-service, and outcome records for the same county and year window.

- Enforcement and docket history: An official federal press release dated October 16, 2025 says Steven Taylor was charged with seven counts of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, and one count of money laundering, and describes a Cheviot Hills property originally acquired for $11.2 million and contracted to sell to a homeless housing developer using City of Los Angeles and State of California public funds for $27.3 million in a double-escrow transaction hidden from the lender. Los Angeles City Clerk records identify the Cheviot Hills/Shelby Homekey 3 project as Weingart-related and later describe The Weingart Shelby at 3340 Shelby Drive. (year(s): 2025; place: Los Angeles; subject: Weingart Center Association; evidence `E08`, `E07`, `enforcement_docket_weingart_center_association_1`, `source_table_enforcement_docket`.)
- State homelessness award exposure: California Department of Housing and Community Development award lists name Weingart Center Association as a co-applicant or project partner on 3 Homekey/Homekey+ project row(s), with total project-award exposure of $95,565,300. Programs: Homekey Round 3. Award year(s): 2023. Counties: Los Angeles. Projects: The Weingart Sycamore, The Weingart Primrose, The Weingart Shelby. (year(s): 2023; place: Los Angeles; subject: Weingart Center Association; evidence `E02`, `E26`, `source_table_state_homeless_awards`, `state_homeless_awards_weingart_center`.)
- Spend-versus-results: official county or Continuum of Care outcome context worsened in the entity's matched project geography: Los Angeles: Los Angeles Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 97,572 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 106,676 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+9.3%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$95,565,300. This is a review signal, not provider attribution. Evidence `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`.
- Source gaps that limit judgment: Audit controls, Direct funding verification, Executive compensation, Facility status; plus 5 other source area(s). These gaps explain what CalDS still cannot test; they are not adverse findings by themselves.

Why this is on the review list: CalDS sees the combination reviewers care about: material public-money exposure or financial movement, plus outcome context that moved the wrong direction in matched service geographies. That does not prove provider responsibility, but it is exactly the mismatch that should be briefed up for document review.

What this does not prove: It does not prove wrongdoing; it is a source-backed review prompt. It does not prove the entity caused county or Continuum of Care outcome movement; it flags a spend/outcome question for review.

Boss-level next step: Open the cited source records for Weingart Center Association and compare the raw source wording to this row.

- Source gaps that limit judgment: Audit controls, Direct funding verification, Enforcement and docket history, Executive compensation; plus 6 other source area(s). These gaps explain what CalDS still cannot test; they are not adverse findings by themselves.

Why this is on the review list: CalDS sees the combination reviewers care about: material public-money exposure or financial movement, plus outcome context that moved the wrong direction in matched service geographies. That does not prove provider responsibility, but it is exactly the mismatch that should be briefed up for document review.

What this does not prove: It does not prove the entity caused county or Continuum of Care outcome movement; it flags a spend/outcome question for review. It does not prove poor performance or misuse; it marks funding exposure that needs source and outcome review.

Boss-level next step: Request provider-attributable utilization, completion, discharge, cost-per-service, and outcome records for the same county and year window.

### Case-wide Source Gaps

These are not nonprofit organization-specific findings. They are run-level blockers that limit how strongly CalDS can rank or clear the case.

- License/adverse-action history: California Department of Health Care Services adverse-action pages were fetched but did not expose machine-readable target rows in static text during this run.
  Evidence: `E03`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`. Human action: Collect the missing source named in the row and rerun the matrix before upgrading the signal.
- Public attention and traffic: No social media account metrics, website analytics, ad-library records, or third-party traffic estimates are ingested in this run.
  Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row. Human action: Collect the missing source named in the row and rerun the matrix before upgrading the signal.


## 3. Score, Sentinel, and Case Context

Lead statement: Retrieved records show a reviewable oversight signal for Hope the Mission, Weingart Center Association focused on homelessness, housing, official.

Score: 7.67 / 100

Interpretation: low deterministic score because unresolved source gaps outweigh the retrieved source coverage under the current scoring formula.

The score is deterministic triage priority, not a probability, not a dollar loss estimate, and not a conclusion. Higher scores mean stronger retrieved-source coverage and entity linkage after missing-data and contradiction penalties.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Support count | 50 |
| Average relevance | 0.505 |
| Source diversity | 8 |

### Sentinel Gate

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Decision | DOWNGRADE_FOR_REVIEW |
| Rationale | Lead can proceed only as an internal reviewer-safe candidate with caveats. |
| Flags | legal_status_context_required, missing_data |

Sentinel repair or caution items:

- Use exact legal status and named-party scope from official sources; do not convert third-party charges into entity-level conclusions.
- Preserve missing-data caveats in the review packet.

### Case Summary

- Case ID: `live_ca_homelessness_top15_2026_04_29`
- Jurisdiction: California
- Objective: Using official California Department of Housing and Community Development Homekey and Homekey+ award lists, official homelessness outcome series, and public organization pages, identify reviewer-safe possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement screening signals among the top source-listed homelessness nonprofit co-applicants by state project-award exposure. Keep the result internal, source-cited, and clear that co-applicant project-award exposure is not the same as verified direct payment to the nonprofit.

## 4. Case Dossier Orientation

Status: `PENDING` human review required

This dossier compiles existing CalDS workflow artifacts into a human-readable case file. It is an internal possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement screening aid, not a formal finding or outside-facing conclusion.

Every substantive row below is tied to a risk indicator, evidence item, source URI, checksum, or durable artifact path. Raw source documents and canonical records remain controlling.

Dossier mode: downgraded internal review dossier with caveats preserved

## 5. Evidence Detail By Entity

This section preserves the system opinion and source-fact detail behind the briefing memo. It remains an internal possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement screening opinion, not a formal allegation or outside-facing conclusion.

### Abode Housing Development

CalDS flags Abode Housing Development as a moderate-priority possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review subject. The entity is in this dossier because the current source bundle contains the specific source facts below.

Specific findings that drove the flag:

1. Medium - State homelessness award exposure: California Department of Housing and Community Development award lists name Abode Housing Development as a co-applicant or project partner on 1 Homekey/Homekey+ project row(s), with total project-award exposure of $41,220,000. Programs: Homekey+. Award year(s): 2025. Counties: Santa Clara. Projects: Algarve Community Apartments.
   - When/where: year(s): 2025; place: Santa Clara; subject: Abode Housing Development
   - How it triggered: Medium State homelessness award exposure screen via test 'Homekey/Homekey+ co-applicant project-award exposure'. Data status: observed.
   - Evidence: `E02`, `E19`, `source_table_state_homeless_awards`, `state_homeless_awards_abode_housing_development`; source: [internal local artifact] https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/hk-plus-awardee-list.pdf
   - Why it matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.

2. Data gap - Audit controls: No Federal Audit Clearinghouse audit-control summary row is present for this entity in the current corpus.
   - When/where: subject: Abode Housing Development
   - How it triggered: Data gap Audit controls screen via test 'Federal Audit Clearinghouse control flags and findings'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: Audit-control flags are direct oversight signals; repeated or unresolved findings can indicate weak controls over public funds.

3. Data gap - Direct funding verification: The California Department of Housing and Community Development award list identifies eligible public applicant(s) and co-applicant(s) for Abode Housing Development, but this run does not recover the standard agreement, payment ledger, subrecipient ledger, or operating-cost draw records needed to verify the exact dollars received by the nonprofit.
   - When/where: subject: Abode Housing Development
   - How it triggered: Data gap Direct funding verification screen via test 'State award direct-recipient and subrecipient allocation coverage'. Data status: missing_source_or_field.
   - Evidence: `E02`, `E19`, `source_table_state_homeless_awards`, `state_homeless_awards_abode_housing_development`; source: [internal local artifact] https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/grants-and-funding/homekey/hk-plus-awardee-list.pdf
   - Why it matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

4. Data gap - Enforcement and docket history: No official enforcement, prosecution, violation, or docket row is present for this entity in the current corpus.
   - When/where: subject: Abode Housing Development
   - How it triggered: Data gap Enforcement and docket history screen via test 'Official enforcement, prosecution, violation, and docket source coverage'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

5. Data gap - Executive compensation: No parsed Part VII compensation total is available in the current Internal Revenue Service table for this entity.
   - When/where: subject: Abode Housing Development
   - How it triggered: Data gap Executive compensation screen via test 'Highest officer/key employee compensation from Form 990 Part VII'. Data status: missing_parser_or_source_field.
   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: High executive pay at a publicly funded service nonprofit is a materiality and governance question; the reviewer needs to know whether pay, approval, and outcomes line up.

6. Data gap - Facility status: No parsed California Department of Health Care Services facility-status summary row is present for this entity.
   - When/where: place: California Department of Health Care Services facility set matched to the entity; subject: Abode Housing Development
   - How it triggered: Data gap Facility status screen via test 'California Department of Health Care Services active/closed facility-status ratio'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: Facility closures or status changes can affect capacity, access, and contract performance; the system treats a high closed-facility ratio as a service-delivery red flag.

- The full matrix contains additional lower-priority source-backed review items for this entity.

Review stance: The system would keep this item active until Federal Audit Clearinghouse findings, management responses, and corrective-action status are checked.

### Burbank Housing Development Corporation

CalDS flags Burbank Housing Development Corporation as a moderate-priority possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review subject. The entity is in this dossier because the current source bundle contains the specific source facts below.

Specific findings that drove the flag:

1. Medium - Spend-versus-results: Burbank Housing Development Corporation has state-award project geography in Napa, Sonoma; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Napa Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 1,090 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 1,217 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+11.7%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$36,385,852.
   - When/where: year(s): 2023, 2024, 2025; place: Napa, Sonoma; subject: Burbank Housing Development Corporation

   - Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`; source: [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.

2. Medium - State homelessness award exposure: California Department of Housing and Community Development award lists name Burbank Housing Development Corporation as a co-applicant or project partner on 2 Homekey/Homekey+ project row(s), with total project-award exposure of $36,385,852.

   - Why it matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.

3. Data gap - Audit controls: No Federal Audit Clearinghouse audit-control summary row is present for this entity in the current corpus.
   - When/where: subject: Burbank Housing Development Corporation
   - How it triggered: Data gap Audit controls screen via test 'Federal Audit Clearinghouse control flags and findings'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: Audit-control flags are direct oversight signals; repeated or unresolved findings can indicate weak controls over public funds.

4. Data gap - Direct funding verification: The California Department of Housing and Community Development award list identifies eligible public applicant(s) and co-applicant(s) for Burbank Housing Development Corporation, but this run does not recover the standard agreement, payment ledger, subrecipient ledger, or operating-cost draw records needed to verify the exact dollars received by the nonprofit.
   - When/where: subject: Burbank Housing Development Corporation
   - How it triggered: Data gap Direct funding verification screen via test 'State award direct-recipient and subrecipient allocation coverage'. Data status: missing_source_or_field.

   - Why it matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

5. Data gap - Enforcement and docket history: No official enforcement, prosecution, violation, or docket row is present for this entity in the current corpus.

   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

6. Data gap - Executive compensation: No parsed Part VII compensation total is available in the current Internal Revenue Service table for this entity.
   - When/where: subject: Burbank Housing Development Corporation
   - How it triggered: Data gap Executive compensation screen via test 'Highest officer/key employee compensation from Form 990 Part VII'. Data status: missing_parser_or_source_field.
   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: High executive pay at a publicly funded service nonprofit is a materiality and governance question; the reviewer needs to know whether pay, approval, and outcomes line up.

- The full matrix contains additional lower-priority source-backed review items for this entity.

Review stance: The system would not close this item from summary records alone; spending and footprint need provider-attributable outcome records.

### California Supportive Housing

CalDS flags California Supportive Housing as a high-priority possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review subject. The entity is in this dossier because the current source bundle contains the specific source facts below.

Specific findings that drove the flag:

1. High - Spend-versus-results: California Supportive Housing has state-award project geography in Alameda, Sacramento; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Alameda Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 13,827 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 15,967 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+15.5%), Sacramento Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 18,432 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 22,889 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+24.2%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$51,891,854.
   - When/where: year(s): 2023, 2024, 2025; place: Alameda, Sacramento; subject: California Supportive Housing
   - How it triggered: High Spend-versus-results screen via test 'County outcome movement and entity spending context: Alameda, Sacramento'. Data status: observed_contextual_join.
   - Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`; source: [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.

2.

### Case-wide

CalDS flags Case-wide as a source-gap review subject. The entity is in this dossier because the current source bundle contains the specific source facts below.

Specific findings that drove the flag:

1. Data gap - License/adverse-action history: California Department of Health Care Services adverse-action pages were fetched but did not expose machine-readable target rows in static text during this run.
   - When/where: subject: Case-wide
   - How it triggered: Data gap License/adverse-action history screen via test 'California Department of Health Care Services adverse-action page machine readability'. Data status: non_machine_readable_source.
   - Evidence: `E03`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`; source: [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

   - Why it matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

3. Low - Spend-versus-results: Official outcome series are ingested and joined into 12 entity/county context rows. These rows remain contextual and are not provider-attributable results.
   - When/where: subject: Case-wide
   - How it triggered: Low Spend-versus-results screen via test 'Outcome-denominator coverage for homelessness, drug use, crime, and treatment results'. Data status: observed.
   - Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`; source: [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.

### PATH Ventures

CalDS flags PATH Ventures as a moderate-priority possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review subject. The entity is in this dossier because the current source bundle contains the specific source facts below.

Specific findings that drove the flag:

1. Medium - Spend-versus-results: PATH Ventures has state-award project geography in Los Angeles; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Los Angeles Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 97,572 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 106,676 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+9.3%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$42,672,927.
   - When/where: year(s): 2023, 2024, 2025; place: Los Angeles; subject: PATH Ventures
   - How it triggered: Medium Spend-versus-results screen via test 'County outcome movement and entity spending context: Los Angeles'. Data status: observed_contextual_join.
   - Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`; source: [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.

2. Medium - State homelessness award exposure: California Department of Housing and Community Development award lists name PATH Ventures as a co-applicant or project partner on 2 Homekey/Homekey+ project row(s), with total project-award exposure of $42,672,927.

   - Why it matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.

3. Data gap - Audit controls: No Federal Audit Clearinghouse audit-control summary row is present for this entity in the current corpus.
   - When/where: subject: PATH Ventures
   - How it triggered: Data gap Audit controls screen via test 'Federal Audit Clearinghouse control flags and findings'. Data status: missing_source.
   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: Audit-control flags are direct oversight signals; repeated or unresolved findings can indicate weak controls over public funds.

4. Data gap - Direct funding verification: The California Department of Housing and Community Development award list identifies eligible public applicant(s) and co-applicant(s) for PATH Ventures, but this run does not recover the standard agreement, payment ledger, subrecipient ledger, or operating-cost draw records needed to verify the exact dollars received by the nonprofit.

   - Evidence: no direct evidence ref in this row; source: not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
   - Why it matters: High executive pay at a publicly funded service nonprofit is a materiality and governance question; the reviewer needs to know whether pay, approval, and outcomes line up.

- The full matrix contains additional lower-priority source-backed review items for this entity.

Review stance: The system would not close this item from summary records alone; spending and footprint need provider-attributable outcome records.

### Weingart Center Association

CalDS flags Weingart Center Association as a high-priority possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review subject. The entity is in this dossier because the current source bundle contains the specific source facts below.

Specific findings that drove the flag:

1. High - Enforcement and docket history: An official federal press release dated October 16, 2025 says Steven Taylor was charged with seven counts of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, and one count of money laundering, and describes a Cheviot Hills property originally acquired for $11.2 million and contracted to sell to a homeless housing developer using City of Los Angeles and State of California public funds for $27.3 million in a double-escrow transaction hidden from the lender. Los Angeles City Clerk records identify the Cheviot Hills/Shelby Homekey 3 project as Weingart-related and later describe The Weingart Shelby at 3340 Shelby Drive.
   - When/where: year(s): 2025; place: Los Angeles; subject: Weingart Center Association
   - How it triggered: High Enforcement and docket history screen via test 'Official federal criminal-case source and City project linkage screen'. Data status: third_party_charged_presumption_of_innocence.
   - Evidence: `E08`, `E07`, `enforcement_docket_weingart_center_association_1`, `source_table_enforcement_docket`; source: https://www.fhfaoig.gov/sites/default/files/Beverly-Hills-Man-Arrested%2C-Brentwood-Man-Charged-in-Separate-Criminal-Cases-Linked-to-Fraud-in-Public-Homelessness-Funds.pdf; [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: The row matters because it is a measurable source-backed proxy for public-funds oversight risk.

2. High - Spend-versus-results: Weingart Center Association has state-award project geography in Los Angeles; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Los Angeles Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 97,572 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 106,676 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+9.3%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$95,565,300.
   - When/where: year(s): 2023, 2024, 2025; place: Los Angeles; subject: Weingart Center Association
   - How it triggered: High Spend-versus-results screen via test 'County outcome movement and entity spending context: Los Angeles'. Data status: observed_contextual_join.
   - Evidence: `E03`, `E04`, `source_table_official_homelessness_outcomes`, `source_table_spend_vs_results_join`; source: [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
   - Why it matters: Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.

3. High - State homelessness award exposure: California Department of Housing and Community Development award lists name Weingart Center Association as a co-applicant or project partner on 3 Homekey/Homekey+ project row(s), with total project-award exposure of $95,565,300. Programs: Homekey Round 3. Award year(s): 2023. Counties: Los Angeles. Projects: The Weingart Sycamore, The Weingart Primrose, The Weingart Shelby.
   - When/where: year(s): 2023; place: Los Angeles; subject: Weingart Center Association
   - How it triggered: High State homelessness award exposure screen via test 'Homekey/Homekey+ co-applicant project-award exposure'. Data status: observed.

   - Why it matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.

4. Data gap - Audit controls: No Federal Audit Clearinghouse audit-control summary row is present for this entity in the current corpus.
   - When/where: subject: Weingart Center Association
   - How it triggered: Data gap Audit controls screen via test 'Federal Audit Clearinghouse control flags and findings'. Data status: missing_source.

## 6. Flagged Review Matrix

Methodology: Waste, fraud, and abuse risk-screening matrix generated from parsed Internal Revenue Service Form 990, Federal Audit Clearinghouse, California Department of Health Care Services facility-status, California Department of Housing and Community Development Homekey/Homekey+ state-award, official enforcement/docket records, county/document index, and retrieved service-page records. The matrix tests observable risk proxies: year-over-year financial growth, spending growth, public-funds concentration, executive compensation, payroll scale, political/lobbying indicators, audit-control flags, enforcement/docket source flags, award concentration, facility closure patterns, off-scope web-language checks, official county or Continuum of Care outcome context, and remaining provider-attributable outcome gaps.

Risk scale: Indicator levels: High=immediate reviewer follow-up, Medium=review queue, Low=context only, Data gap=required source missing or not parsed. Levels are screening priorities, not findings or allegations.

| Risk level | Count |
| --- | --- |
| High | 11 |
| Medium | 17 |
| Data gap | 151 |
| Low | 31 |

High and medium rows are review priorities. Data-gap rows are source-collection blockers. Low rows are not expanded here unless they are needed for context.

### High Rows

#### High-1: Weingart Center Association - Enforcement and docket history

- Test: Official federal criminal-case source and City project linkage screen
- What CalDS found: An official federal press release dated October 16, 2025 says Steven Taylor was charged with seven counts of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, and one count of money laundering, and describes a Cheviot Hills property originally acquired for $11.2 million and contracted to sell to a homeless housing developer using City of Los Angeles and State of California public funds for $27.3 million in a double-escrow transaction hidden from the lender. Los Angeles City Clerk records identify the Cheviot Hills/Shelby Homekey 3 project as Weingart-related and later describe The Weingart Shelby at 3340 Shelby Drive.
- When/where: year(s): 2025; place: Los Angeles; subject: Weingart Center Association
- How this triggered review: High Enforcement and docket history screen via test 'Official federal criminal-case source and City project linkage screen'. Data status: third_party_charged_presumption_of_innocence.
- Evidence refs: `E08`, `E07`, `enforcement_docket_weingart_center_association_1`, `source_table_enforcement_docket`
- Source URI(s): https://www.fhfaoig.gov/sites/default/files/Beverly-Hills-Man-Arrested%2C-Brentwood-Man-Charged-in-Separate-Criminal-Cases-Linked-to-Fraud-in-Public-Homelessness-Funds.pdf; [internal local artifact]
- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a high possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review priority because An official federal press release dated October 16, 2025 says Steven Taylor was charged with seven counts of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, and one count of money laundering, and describes a Cheviot Hills property originally acquired for $11.2 million and contracted to sell to a homeless housing developer using City of Los Angeles and State of California public funds for $27.3 million in a double-escrow transaction hidden from the lender. Los Angeles City Clerk records identify the Cheviot Hills/Shelby Homekey 3 project as Weingart-related and later describe The Weingart Shelby at 3340 Shelby Drive. This source fact matches the implemented enforcement and docket history screen and should stay in the active review queue.
- Why this matters: The row matters because it is a measurable source-backed proxy for public-funds oversight risk.
- What this flags: Open the federal press release, City Clerk Homekey authorization, and 2026 operations report; verify case number, named parties, property address, project agreements, payment flows, due diligence records, and whether any official source names Weingart as charged or only as transaction counterparty/operator.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove wrongdoing; it is a source-backed review prompt.
- Human next step: Open the cited source records for Weingart Center Association and compare the raw source wording to this row.
- Caveat: The official federal source charges Taylor, not Weingart Center Association.
- Caveat: The row is a deep-dive trigger because public homelessness funds and a Weingart-linked project appear in the official-source chain.
- Caveat: A criminal charge is an allegation; every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court.
- Caveat: Use exact legal status from the official source; do not convert third-party charges into entity-level findings.

#### High-2: California Supportive Housing - Spend-versus-results

- Test: County outcome movement and entity spending context: Alameda, Sacramento
- What CalDS found: California Supportive Housing has state-award project geography in Alameda, Sacramento; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Alameda Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 13,827 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 15,967 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+15.5%), Sacramento Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 18,432 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 22,889 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+24.2%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$51,891,854.

- Source URI(s): [internal local artifact] [internal local artifact]
- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a high possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review priority because California Supportive Housing has state-award project geography in Alameda, Sacramento; official county or Continuum of Care context flags Alameda Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 13,827 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 15,967 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+15.5%), Sacramento Continuum of Care M1a service-system volume increased from 18,432 in Jan 2023 - Dec 2023 to 22,889 in Jul 2024 - Jun 2025 (+24.2%). Parsed entity growth context: spending=not parsed, revenue=not parsed, government grants=not parsed. State project-award exposure=$51,891,854. This source fact matches the implemented spend-versus-results screen and should stay in the active review queue.
- Why this matters: Spending growth next to worsening county-level outcomes is not provider-attributable by itself, but it is exactly the mismatch CalDS should force into review.
- What this flags: Review underlying county or Continuum of Care outcome rows, state-award project geography, contract geography, and provider-specific outcome records before drawing any conclusion.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove the entity caused county or Continuum of Care outcome movement; it flags a spend/outcome question for review.
- Human next step: Request provider-attributable utilization, completion, discharge, cost-per-service, and outcome records for the same county and year window.
- Caveat: County and Continuum of Care outcomes are not provider-attributable without direct program outcome records.
- Caveat: This join compares state project-award exposure to official geography-level homelessness service-system movement, not audited spend or client outcomes.
- Caveat: The award-list exposure total is not a verified direct-payment total to the nonprofit.

- Why this matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.
- What this flags: Verify California Department of Housing and Community Development source rows, standard agreements, eligible applicant, co-applicant role, draw records, and any subrecipient allocation before treating project-award exposure as direct receipt.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove poor performance or misuse; it marks funding exposure that needs source and outcome review.
- Human next step: Trace award programs to contracts, grant terms, deliverables, and provider-attributable outcome reports.
- Caveat: This is project-award exposure assigned to source-listed co-applicants; allocation among co-applicants is not stated in the award lists.
- Caveat: The screen prioritizes materiality and follow-up, not a finding that funds were mishandled.

- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a high possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review priority because California Department of Housing and Community Development award lists name DignityMoves as a co-applicant or project partner on 3 Homekey/Homekey+ project row(s), with total project-award exposure of $77,180,702. Programs: Homekey Round 3, Homekey+. Award year(s): 2023, 2024, 2025. Counties: Alameda, San Bernardino, Ventura. Projects: San Bernardino Community Wellness Campus, Dignity Village, Homekey+ Lewis Road. This source fact matches the implemented state homelessness award exposure screen and should stay in the active review queue.
- Why this matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.
- What this flags: Verify California Department of Housing and Community Development source rows, standard agreements, eligible applicant, co-applicant role, draw records, and any subrecipient allocation before treating project-award exposure as direct receipt.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove poor performance or misuse; it marks funding exposure that needs source and outcome review.
- Human next step: Trace award programs to contracts, grant terms, deliverables, and provider-attributable outcome reports.
- Caveat: This is project-award exposure assigned to source-listed co-applicants; allocation among co-applicants is not stated in the award lists.
- Caveat: The screen prioritizes materiality and follow-up, not a finding that funds were mishandled.

- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a medium possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review priority because California Department of Housing and Community Development award lists name Abode Housing Development as a co-applicant or project partner on 1 Homekey/Homekey+ project row(s), with total project-award exposure of $41,220,000. Programs: Homekey+. Award year(s): 2025. Counties: Santa Clara. Projects: Algarve Community Apartments. This source fact matches the implemented state homelessness award exposure screen and should stay in the active review queue.
- Why this matters: Large public-funds exposure raises the stakes of any control, deliverable, or outcome weakness because taxpayer dollars are material.
- What this flags: Verify California Department of Housing and Community Development source rows, standard agreements, eligible applicant, co-applicant role, draw records, and any subrecipient allocation before treating project-award exposure as direct receipt.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove poor performance or misuse; it marks funding exposure that needs source and outcome review.
- Human next step: Trace award programs to contracts, grant terms, deliverables, and provider-attributable outcome reports.
- Caveat: This is project-award exposure assigned to source-listed co-applicants; allocation among co-applicants is not stated in the award lists.
- Caveat: The screen prioritizes materiality and follow-up, not a finding that funds were mishandled.

- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a data blocker because The California Department of Housing and Community Development award list identifies eligible public applicant(s) and co-applicant(s) for Service First Northern California, but this run does not recover the standard agreement, payment ledger, subrecipient ledger, or operating-cost draw records needed to verify the exact dollars received by the nonprofit. Without the missing source, the system cannot responsibly downgrade or clear the issue.
- Why this matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.
- What this flags: Pull the state standard agreement, draw/payment records, and local subrecipient contracts before making direct-recipient or cost-allowability claims.

- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a data blocker because No parsed Part VII compensation total is available in the current Internal Revenue Service table for this entity. Without the missing source, the system cannot responsibly downgrade or clear the issue.
- Why this matters: High executive pay at a publicly funded service nonprofit is a materiality and governance question; the reviewer needs to know whether pay, approval, and outcomes line up.
- What this flags: Parse Part VII from the raw return and compare officer/key-employee pay against peers, program scale, and compensation-policy disclosures.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove compensation is improper; board approval, comparability, role scope, and peer context must be reviewed.
- Human next step: Verify the underlying Form 990 officer table, board approval process, comparability data, and related-organization compensation context.
- Caveat: The current test does not infer reasonableness; it only flags pay levels for reviewer comparison.

Without the missing source, the system cannot responsibly downgrade or clear the issue.
- Why this matters: A missing source can hide the answer either way; the system keeps the issue open until the gap is resolved.

- Source URI(s): not listed on this row; use evidence ledger
- System opinion: CalDS flags this as a data blocker because No two downloaded Internal Revenue Service returns with numeric expenses are available for this entity. Available parsed years: none. Without the missing source, the system cannot responsibly downgrade or clear the issue.
- Why this matters: Rapid revenue or expense growth becomes a possible waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement review concern when it outpaces visible service capacity, documented outcomes, or clear grant-scope explanations.
- What this flags: Check whether expense growth maps to funded scope, staffing, facilities, and documented service results.
- What this does not prove: It does not prove misuse; growth can have ordinary program, accounting, merger, or grant-timing explanations.
- Human next step: Compare raw Internal Revenue Service machine-readable filing data/source document returns year over year, then separate program growth, grants, mergers, one-time receipts, and expense categories.
- Caveat: A missing year is not an adverse signal by itself, but it prevents the growth test.

## 8. Human-Only Next Steps

These actions are outside the current CalDS runtime. They require a human reviewer or authorized records process before any escalation beyond internal review.

1. Open the review packet and verify each priority row against the cited evidence ledger before changing case status.
2. Resolve sentinel caution: Use exact legal status and named-party scope from official sources; do not convert third-party charges into entity-level conclusions.
3. Resolve sentinel caution: Preserve missing-data caveats in the review packet.
4. Request county contract files, monitoring letters, corrective-action status, deliverables, and provider-level outcome records for the same year window.
5. Benchmark officer and key employee compensation against comparable organizations and verify documented approval procedures.
6. Compare harvested public statements and web pages to grant scopes, contract restrictions, and accounting records; treat statements as context only.
